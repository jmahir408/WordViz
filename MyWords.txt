This is a consular ship. We're on a diplomatic mission.

If this is a consular ship, where is the ambassador?

Commander, tear this ship apart until you've found those plans!

And bring me the passengers! I want them alive!

There's one. Set for stun.

She'll be all right.

Inform Lord Vader we have a prisoner.

Hey. You're not permitted in there. It's restricted.

You'll be deactivated for sure.

Don't call me a mindless philosopher, you overweight glob of grease.

Come out, before somebody sees you.

Secret mission? What plans?

What are you talking about? I'm not getting in there.
